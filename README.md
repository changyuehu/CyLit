We conduct a series of experiments to assess the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT-4,  on literature reviews. As documented in the table below. These experiments were designed to explore various applications of ChatGPT in literature review tasks.![experiments](https://github.com/changyuehu/CyLit/assets/66393857/c53b2af3-4534-4175-a685-6f2171b62520)


Experiment I focuses on categorizing 36 selected papers on cyber risk. This experiment was replicated three times to evaluate the consistency of ChatGPT's outputs. Experiments II and III built upon the first by introducing more guided information: Experiment II involves providing ChatGPT with predefined topics based on human judgment, while Experiment III guides the model to follow methodologies similar to those used in our system. Subsequent experiments, IV through VI, were aimed at assessing ChatGPT's ability to summarize and critically review individual papers. These papers, representing diverse aspects of cyber risk, are sampled from the 36 papers. 

It is important to note that multiple trials were conducted for each experiment and instances of failures in generating outputs were not uncommon. Only those instances where ChatGPT successfully generated results are presented and analyzed. For a detailed examination of the prompts provided to ChatGPT and its responses across these experiments, see the chat links belows.
